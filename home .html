<p>We set out to establish a quick service type automotive shop in 1983. We were dissatisfied with the service provided by the automotive industry: Greasy waiting areas, untrained staff, poor communication, inconsistent pricing, unreasonable charges, poor accountability, and various other issues plaguing the industry at the time.

To date we have started and managed and eventually sold to qualified owner-operators 3 stores that provide a high level of professional and quality automotive services. They are all independently owned and operated and run under different names, but they all provide the same level of excellence in service because they are proudly managed by qualified owner-operators with strong automotive backgrounds, and more importantly the desire to succeed in their career and ventures.

Busy Buggy is a small family owned and operated garage that specializes in offering our customers the best possible personal service. Come experience the difference it makes when a business is managed with passion, experience, and a deep desire to do be the best host a person can be.</p>
